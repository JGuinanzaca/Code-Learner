# Code-Learner

An in-browser code learning tool (Capstone Project).

Our platform helps users learn how to code through guided tutorials, interactive exercises, and real-time feedbackâ€”all in one place.

- Make sure Node.js is at v24.2.0 (node -v in terminal to check your current version)
- Once you clone the repo, just cd to backend and npm install. The same for frontend.
